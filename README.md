# Space Debris Token (SDT)

## Overview

Space Debris Token (SDT) is a blockchain-based platform designed to incentivize and manage space debris removal missions. The project uses a custom fungible token and smart contract system to coordinate and reward space debris cleanup efforts.

## Key Components

### 1. Fungible Token (Space Debris Token)
- Custom token for mission rewards and funding
- Mintable and transferable
- Managed by contract owner

### 2. Funding Pool
- Allows contributors to fund space debris removal missions
- Tracks total funds and individual contributor amounts
- Supports fund deposit and withdrawal by contract owner

### 3. Removal Missions
- Create and manage space debris removal missions
- Missions have unique IDs, debris identifiers, and rewards
- Supports mission creation, assignment, and completion

## Smart Contract Functions

### Token Management
- `mint(amount, recipient)`: Mint new tokens (owner-only)
- `transfer(amount, sender, recipient)`: Transfer tokens between accounts
- `get-balance(account)`: Check token balance
- `get-token-uri()`: Retrieve token metadata URI
- `set-token-uri(new-uri)`: Update token metadata URI (owner-only)

### Funding Pool
- `fund(amount, sdt-trait)`: Contribute tokens to the funding pool
- `withdraw(amount, recipient, sdt-trait)`: Withdraw funds (owner-only)
- `get-funder-amount(funder)`: Check individual contributor's funding
- `get-total-funds()`: Check total funds in the pool

### Mission Management
- `create-mission(debris-id, reward)`: Create a new removal mission (owner-only)
- `assign-mission(mission-id, assignee)`: Assign a mission to an entity (owner-only)
- `complete-mission(mission-id, sdt-trait)`: Mark a mission as complete and reward the assignee (owner-only)
- `get-mission-info(mission-id)`: Retrieve mission details

## Error Handling
- Custom error codes for various scenarios:
    - `err-owner-only`: Unauthorized access
    - `err-not-enough-tokens`: Insufficient token balance
    - `err-insufficient-funds`: Inadequate funds in the pool
    - `err-already-assigned`: Mission already assigned
    - `err-not-assigned`: Mission not assigned
    - `err-invalid-status`: Invalid mission status

## Usage Restrictions
- Most critical functions are restricted to the contract owner
- Ensures controlled and secure management of tokens and missions

## Deployment Considerations
- Deployed on a blockchain supporting Clarity smart contracts
- Requires proper initialization of contract owner and initial parameters

## Potential Improvements
- Implement more granular access controls
- Add mission validation and verification mechanisms
- Develop a more comprehensive reward calculation system
- Create additional token utility features
